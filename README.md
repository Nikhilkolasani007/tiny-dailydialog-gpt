# 🚀 tiny-dailydialog-gpt

This is my **first custom-trained AI text generation model**, built using the Hugging Face `transformers` library and trained on the `daily_dialog` dataset in **Google Colab**.

📝 **Note:**  
This is an experimental project — the model might not generate perfect results yet. I'm still improving it and learning through the process!

---

## 📦 Model Details:

- Model Type: Causal Language Model (GPT-like)
- Trained on: `daily_dialog` dataset
- Training Platform: Google Colab (Free Tier)
- Tokenizer & Model files are stored in the folder: `tiny-dailydialog-gpt/`

---

## 📥 Download & Run the Model Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Perfect, Nikhil — congratulations on your first AI model repo! 🎉
Let’s draft a clean, beginner-friendly `README.md` for your repo explaining what it is, what it does, and noting that it’s your first attempt with possible issues.

### 2️⃣ Unzip the model:

```bash
unzip tiny-dailydialog-gpt.zip
```

### 3️⃣ Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Text Generation Script:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline

model_path = "./tiny-dailydialog-gpt"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path)

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
output = generator("Hello, how are you?", max_new_tokens=50)

print(output[0]['generated_text'])
```

## 📝 What's Next

I’ll continue to improve this model, experiment with other datasets, and tune hyperparameters for better performance.
If you'd like to collaborate or give feedback — feel free to fork or open an issue!
